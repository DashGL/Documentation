## Emulators

### PPSSPP

With respect to the Playstation Portable, there is only one emulator: PPSSPP. While PPSSPP is open source, the save state compression method and offsets of memory and vram are currently unknown. Otherwise PPSSPP doesn't offer too much functionality out of the box.&#x20;

The exception to that is that PPSSPP started offering a web socket interface to allow for reading (and likely injecting) memory or vram from a game. So it's possible that this would allow for a lot of customization for debugging. However I have not looked into this approach.&#x20;

Otherwise PPSSPP likely allows for executing of `.EXE` files outside of an image, but I have not had any luck with this approach either.&#x20;
