### Emulators

At this point a Playstation emulator can be run on a toaster, or a remotely fast potato of a computer. The following is a list of the most common Playstation emulators.&#x20;

* PCSXR
* ePSXe
* no$PSX
* Duck Station

#### PCSXR

Available On: Linux and Windows (sort of)

PCSXR is the easiest emulator to work with as it is open source. That means if you need to look at the code, or make changes you can. While you may not need to, the ability to do this was what allowed me to unpack the save state format to be able to export and see the save state format.&#x20;

This emulator works really well on Linux and Raspberry Pi and can be installed with the following command on Debian based distributions.

```
sudo apt-get install pcsxr
```

While there is an installer on Windows, the application is not actively supported and maintained in that environment, which means you may get lucky and the application will work. But otherwise on Windows, the recomendation is to use **Duck Station**.&#x20;
