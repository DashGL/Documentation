## Config File

The game include a config file named `dash2.cfg` in the Program Files folder for the game. This file likely includes resolution, and key mappings for the game. Currently the structure of this file is not documented.&#x20;

## Notable Mods

### Debug Version

For some reason the Hong Kong version of the game includes all of the debug features in the executable of the game. This executable works with the Japanese version of the game, and the download link can be found here: [https://twitter.com/Skaarg/status/1601791262772035586](https://twitter.com/Skaarg/status/1601791262772035586)

### Windowed Version

The game only runs in full screen. And while the options menu does have an option for `Fullscreen`, there does not seem to be any way to toggle this to windowed mode.&#x20;

### English Patch

Currently does not exist. The game uses the same file formats as the PlayStation version with the only difference being the `.BIN/.DAT` bundle files that the game comes with, and some compression on the PlayStation files. If the game's script and audio files could be located, then an English patch is plausible.&#x20;
